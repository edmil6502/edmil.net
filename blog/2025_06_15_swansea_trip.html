# Swansea University CISM Tour and Talk
## Overview
Swansea University have recently opened their Centre for Integrative Semiconductor materials, a building dedicated towards semiconductor research and education. The BCS South Wales branch and the IET Wales South West branch decided to do a joint event wherein attendees would be given a tour of the new facility and its capabilities, and then afterwards attend a lecture given by Prof. Mike Jennings of Swansea University, covering new types of semiconductors.

Being in Aberystwyth (and without a car), the trek to Swansea was a little dire - two and a half hours on the bus, followed by an hour on the train! Not dreadful, but not ideal by any means. I had hoped someone else from the Mid-Wales branch would be in attendance (and preferably someone with a car), but I was out of luck. Thankfully, my friend Nia was more than happy to come along, so we made a bit of an adventure of it! Thursday morning came along, and we began our journey.

Arriving in Swansea a few hours later, it was absolutely tipping it down - I couldn't really see where I was going, my glasses would just get covered in droplets in seconds! Taking them off didn't really help matters either, for obvious reasons. After the world's longest twenty minute walk, we finally made it to our hotel, dried ourselves off, and had a well-earned cuppa and lunch.

## CISM Tour
The tour of the Centre for Integrative Semiconductor Materials started at around half six in the evening, and was conducted by Dr. Matt Elwin. Dr. Elwin began by showing us some of the offices, but the really juicy stuff was their main chip fab.
