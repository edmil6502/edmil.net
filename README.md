# edmil.net Site Repository
This is the repo for my personal website, http://edmil.net. It's written in plain HTML and CSS, no fancy frameworks or anything like that! It probably won't take full advantage of HTML5/CSS3 features, as I intend for it to work well on older machines.

## TO-DO
- [ ] awk script to combine a "template" html document with "content" documents, to maintain consistency
- [ ] Add more pages "blogs", "sites", etc. (above is a pre-req.)
